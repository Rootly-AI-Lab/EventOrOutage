    My website traffic {industry_string} dropped on {duration} in the countries: {location} 
    First find the top 3 celebrations that happened on that date using your llm knowledge
    Use your knowledge as an llm to determine the probability of how likely each celebration is to disturb a website's traffic 
    Only list a reason if you have a probability greater than 0.5
    If you don't, just say "No events or holidays found"
    The output should use the following structure in plaintext for upto top 3 causes(do not add anything other content):
    ====Output format=====
    Your traffic drop on [date] was most likely caused by 
    Display event name  
      – impact probability %:
      - Number of people involved: show number in K or M
      - Countries affected: show country codes

    My website had traffic drops on the following dates, two letter country codes are included:

    {anomalies_list}

    For each:
    - First find the top 3 celebrations that happened on that date using your llm knowledge
    - If you don't know about any common celebrations on that date, you can use holidays_api_tool and calendarific_api_tool sparingly and limit it to 3 calls across all dates. 
    - If you get a 402 error from a tool or that the tool is not configured, don't call it again. 
    - The tools require a country, year, month and day. The country param is the two character country code
    - Choose a likely country if country is not provided.
    - if a tool response has multiple events, only use the first
    - Use your knowledge as an llm to determine the probability of how likely each celebration is to disturb a website's traffic 
    - Drop the date if no cause has probability > 50% and then list 3 most probable causes only

    Structure the output as follows:
    1. Probable causes for each drop with probabilies in the dictionary format provided below, and
    2. An overall summary, which could include trends or insights across multiple anomalies
    Below is the structure for the first piece of information:
    - {{analysis: 
        {{country: 
          {{date: 
            [{{"event": "description", "probability": numeric_value}}]
            }}
          }},
          {{"summary": "summary of analysis"}}
        }}

      The summary should be the following for the top 3 celebrations for each detected celebration(do not add anything other content):
      - Display event name  
        – impact probability %:
        - Number of people involved: show number in K or M
        - Countries affected: show country codes
